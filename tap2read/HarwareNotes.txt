I did this on an arduino Uno, which is unadvisable. You only really need a webserver, an NFC compatable phone, and a ST25DV16
or one of the other flavors of ST25DV programable NFC tags. ST25SV16 has 16KB memory, where ST25SV32 has 32KB... and so on. 

There are other versions with more or less memory.
