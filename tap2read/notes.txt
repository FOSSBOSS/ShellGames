So I went home and tested this thing, on my phone, computer, and a freinds phone.
It works ok ish. Friends phone warns my server is http. 
My phone: loads some of the pdfs. The straight to pdf, with no other info posted 
is a nusiance, noticed immediately when some pages would fail to load. Some of this 
was permission issues, others had ahem, non standard filenames that cuase problems in browsers.
I cleaned all that up. 

I got a new phone case. It has a little shield over the camera, which is also where the NFC reader is.
This is sufficent to block NFC reading, while the cover is closed. 

The added thickness of having this trap door, is also sufficent to make scanning dificult, if the tag is behind the wooden plate I made.
I made a thinner display plate using craft paper, which aliviates most of this.
