Ok, after figuring out how to make this thing work, I had some extra stuff to clean up. 
my x11 conf files got pretty cluttered, and I had to fix all the configs to get this working on both screens. 
Configuring x11 to work proper with or without the keyboard was complictated, so I did something else.

First, I cleand up all the bugus configs in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
I got rid of all the config files there, with the plan to use xrandr to configure the displays.

in my local path /home/user/bin I made this script:

#!/bin/bash
export DISPLAY=:0
# Saved as displayLink.sh marked executable
# Wait for the DisplayLink device to show up
for i in {1..10}; do
  if xrandr | grep -q "DVI-I-2"; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done

# Add mode if not already present
xrandr | grep -q "1920x440_60.00" || \
  xrandr --newmode "1920x440_60.00" 58.25 1920 1968 2168 2416 440 443 453 460 -hsync +vsync

# Add mode to the DisplayLink device
xrandr --addmode DVI-I-2 "1920x440_60.00"

# Position it to the right you can move it in the gui later if you want
xrandr --output DVI-I-2 --mode "1920x440_60.00" --right-of HDMI-1


so then I made the folder ~/.config/autostart
and made the file displayLink.desktop
in this file:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/home/l/bin/displayLink.sh
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-MATE-Autostart-enabled=true
Name=DisplayLink Setup


then rebooted.
When i rebooted, the display just works. if  it is unplugged everything keeps working. 
the design is very human, doesnt break, and is easy to use with the xrandr gui.

I tried lots of things, to make this work, got a long list of what not to do.

the autostart system is very flexible, you can make it work on gnome or whatver
