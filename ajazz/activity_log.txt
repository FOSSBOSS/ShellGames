try display link drivers. the racertech driver is a derivative of this.
the included gzip file is not an actual gzip, decompress with tar -xvf evdi.tar.gz
then run make, sudo make install.
evdi display drivers.....

poked around the jeili usb device, it seems to be non writable, maybe its a nand flash. 
Despite showing up as a usb filesystem. I suspect that device holds the logo image, and may be a read only system, 
although I can not read it. I suspect a properly compiled firmware might read from this device.
